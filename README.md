## Challenges & Plan
* 3/15 Before Class - Last Friday, my tutor and I attempted to reset my MySQL password. We accidentally changed the email and I no longer have access to my account. I scheduled a tutoring session to address the issue on 3/15, but my tutor was sick and cancelled the appointment. Our schedules do not align the rest of the week, so I will be attempting to fix the issue in office hours before/after class.
* 3/15 After Class - Worked with TAs before, during, and after to get access to MySQL. 
* 3/20 - I spent the week studying MySQL and working toward completing the challenge. I was not able to get the server running succesfully. I have a support session scheduled for 3/23 to review this assignment with my tutor. I will be resubmitting after the meeting.
